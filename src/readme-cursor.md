# Nextflow extension for Cursor

## Available commands

Open the command palette and type `Nextflow` to see the following commands:

- `Show welcome page`
- `Restart language server`
- `Stop language server`

## Seqera AI

Cursor does not currently support custom AI functionality.

To fully leverage Seqera workspaces & [Seqera AI](https://ai.seqera.io/), you can install it on VS Code.

### Add the `@Nextflow` command to Cursor Chat

In order for Cursor to have access to the Nextflow docs, perform the following steps:

- Open the chat window
- Type `@Docs`
- Click `+ Add new doc`
- Paste `https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/`

Now you will be able to use the `@Nextflow` command in Cursor Chat.
The same can be done for MultiQC or other products.
