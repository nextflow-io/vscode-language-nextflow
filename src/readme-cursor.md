# Nextflow extension for Cursor

## Available commands

Open the command palette and type `Nextflow` to see the following commands:

- Show Welcome Page
- Chat with Seqera
- Convert to DSL2 with Seqera
- Restart language server
- Stop language server

## Seqera AI

Cursor does not currently support custom AI functionality.

To fully leverage Seqera workspaces & [Seqera AI](https://ai.seqera.io/), you can install it on VS Code.

### Add the `@Nextflow` command to Cursor Chat

In order for Cursor to have access to the Nextflow docs, perform the following steps:

1. Open the chat window
2. Type `@Docs`
3. Click `+ Add new doc`
4. Paste `https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/`

Now you will be able to use the `@Nextflow` command in Cursor Chat. The same can be done for MultiQC or other tools.
