# Nextflow extension for Cursor

Cursor does not currently support custom AI functionality.
To fully leverage Seqera workspaces & Seqera AI, you can install it on VS Code.

## Add the `@Nextflow` command to Cursor Chat

In order for Cursor to have access to the Nextflow docs, perform the following steps:

- Open the chat window
- Type `@Docs`
- Click `+ Add new doc`
- Paste `https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/`

Now you will be able to use the `@Nextflow` command in Cursor Chat.
The same can be done for MultiQC or other products.
