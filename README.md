The extension includes a GitHub Copilot extension specifically trained for Nextflow development:

- Full support for Nextflow DSL2 syntax
- Context-aware assistance that understands your specific codebase
- Generates code following Nextflow best practices and patterns
- Works with any LLM you have access to (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) through Github Copilot (Sonnet 3.5 is recommended by the Seqera team)
- Special commands:
  - `/dsl2` - Convert DSL1 scripts to DSL2
  - `/nf-test` - Assists in generating nf-test test cases and improving test coverage

## Requirements

The language server requires Java 17 or later.
